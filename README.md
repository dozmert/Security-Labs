# Security-Labs
This is my offensive security blog/repo that’s very much a work in progress meant for students and beginners. Write-ups are nothing new however, I’m aiming to reinforce what I have learned by trying to explain it to others. I will mainly look to grasp onto fundamentals and industry tricks rather than show off fancy techniques. As this blog/repo matures it will look diffrent from when it first started.

I have based most of my document on a general concept of the intrusion kill-chain:
Reconnaissance > Weaponization > Delivery > Exploitation > Installation > Command & Control > Actions on Objective
