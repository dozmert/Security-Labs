# Hack This Site - Basic Challenges
| Level | Desecription | Resolution |

| 1 | Basic test of your skills to see if you can do any of these missions. Requirements: HTM | The password can be found within the HTML source of the page. |
| 2 | A slightly more difficult challenge, involving an incomplete password script. Requirements: Common sense. | With the failed upload of the password file, there is nothing to check inputs against. |
| 3 | Some intuition is needed to find the location of the hidden password file. Requirements: Basic HTML knowledge | Password can be fetched from password.php within the directory. |
| 4 | An email script has been set up, which sends the password to the administrator. Requirements: HTML knowledge, an email address | The input form can be modified to send the password to your email instead of Sam's. |
| 5 | Similar to the previous challenge, but with some extra security measures in place. Requirements: HTML knowledge, JS or FF, an email address. | The input for can be modified again to send the password to your email instead of Sam's. |
| 6 | An encryption system has been set up, which uses an unknown algorithm to change the text given. Requirements: Persistence, some general cryptography knowledge. | Work with an ASCII table and the encryption form to reverse engineer the password. |
| 7 | The password is hidden in an unknown file, and Sam has set up a script to display a calendar. Requirements: Basic UNIX command knowledge. | Employ XSS to break out of the cal input and list directory files. Password can be found in a .php file. |
| 8 | The password is yet again hidden in an unknown file. Sam's daughter has begun learning PHP, and has a small script to demonstrate her knowledge. Requirements: Knowledge of SSI (dynamic html executed by the server, rather than the browser) | The url in the name submission page can be SSI'd to reveal the page's .php using `<!--#exec cmd="ls ../" -->` |
| 9 | The password is again hidden in an unknown file. However, the script that was previously used to find it has some limitations. Requirements: Knowledge of SSI, unix directory structure. | Reading the description of the challenge, it hints that level 8's form can be used to complete level 9. This is done by modifying the previous SSI `<!--#exec cmd="ls ../../9/" -->` |
| 10 | This time Sam used a more temporary and "hidden" approach to authenticating users, but he didn't think about whether or not those users knew their way around javascript... | Upon examination of the POST request when attempting any password, a 'level10_authorized' cookie header can be found set to 'no'. When flipped to 'yes', you're granted access.  |
| 11 | Sam decided to make a music site. Unfortunately he does not understand Apache. This mission is a bit harder than the other basics. | An index.php can be found with an a login form. After some experimentation /a, /b etc. a directory listing is found. Once followed to the end, Apache's .htaccess file can be accessed. This will display hidden/ignored files. From here experimentation will get you access through the login form. |
