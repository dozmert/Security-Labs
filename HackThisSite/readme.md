| Basic 2 | A slightly more difficult challenge, involving an incomplete password script. Requirements: Common sense. | With the failed upload of the password file, there is nothing to check inputs against. |

| Basic 11 | Sam decided to make a music site. Unfortunately he does not understand Apache. This mission is a bit harder than the other basics. | x |
